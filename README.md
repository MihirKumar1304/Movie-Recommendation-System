A movie recommendation system leveraging machine learning can employ both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering models to suggest movies to users. Collaborative filtering predicts a user's preferences by analyzing the patterns and preferences of many users, typically through user-item interactions, such as ratings. Conversely, content-based filtering focuses on the attributes of the movies, such as genre, director, and actors, to recommend films similar to those the user has liked in the past. In a comparative study, both models were evaluated for their accuracy using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the performance metric. The results revealed that the content-based filtering model outperformed the collaborative filtering model, demonstrating a lower RMSE value, thereby indicating higher accuracy in predicting user preferences. This suggests that leveraging the intrinsic features of movies can provide more precise recommendations than relying solely on user interaction data.
